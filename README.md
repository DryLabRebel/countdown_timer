Countdown Timer
===============

A *very* simple countdown timer.

> TODO: Add option to input hours or minutes

Welcome to the countdown timer.

This program takes a single integer as an unnamed argument, as input to designate the number of minutes (default 5) to run the countdown timer.

The countdown will run for 5 minutes if no argument is supplied.
